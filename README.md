Bash script to stay organised with the links you want to save for any of your projects
## Requirement(s)

## Why this repository ?

First of all, I figured out that my browser was full charged with tabs, most of them were opened for something like 4 months, I didn't want to lose them so I ended up opening more & more tabs.

I finally created this tool and bring it to you
